"""v0.9.9 behavioral test — master-analyze fallback derives classification from manifest.

ROOT-CAUSE FIX for v0.9.8 RT iter-2 GENERATIVE-bypass.

Symptom (RT iter-2, run <run_id>):
    The VIBE_MASTER_PROMPT timed out at 720s SQL timeout. The caller fallback
    at `step_interpret_model_instructions` then hardcoded
    `vibe_classification['classification'] = 'GENERATIVE'`, completely ignoring
    the orchestrator's already-successful parse (manifest.overall_mode=surgical
    with 85/85 per-requirement modes=surgical).

Result chain:
    master_analyze returns None (timeout)
    -> caller fallback sets classification='GENERATIVE' (HARDCODED, no manifest read)
    -> compile_vibe_contract reads vibe_classification['classification']='GENERATIVE'
    -> contract.mode='GENERATIVE'
    -> mutation pipeline bypassed
    -> 0 mutation_applied events
    -> 0% structural adherence on RT (vs 82% on HC which did NOT time out)

v0.9.9 fix:
    When master_analyze returns None/raises, the caller fallback now:
      1. Reads `_orch.manifest.requirements` (already successfully parsed).
      2. Aggregates per-requirement `mode` via deterministic majority rule.
      3. Falls through to `manifest.overall_mode` if per-requirement modes empty.
      4. Falls through to GENERATIVE only as a TRUE last resort (empty manifest).

    Generic, no regex on text, no industry strings, no hardcoded entity names.
    The aggregation is a pure Counter pattern over an enum field already
    populated by the LLM parse step.

Sentinel: '[master-failure-mode-from-manifest FIRED]' on recovery,
          '[master-failure-mode-from-manifest FALLBACK]' on empty-manifest GENERATIVE,
          '[master-failure-mode-from-manifest ERROR]' on unexpected attribute access.
