"""Behavioral + contract tests for v3.2.4 vov-verify-already-satisfied.

Live failure reproduced (gov_transport mvm_v3 clean+matched, run <run_id>,
2026-06-04): the VOV adherence ceilinged at 50.0% (24/48). The dominant
residual cause was NOT missing targets — it was the LLM mutator's rule-4
self-check `raise ValueError('mutator did not touch any target entity')`
(and the '... did not remove any fabricated FK' variant) firing on
VERIFICATION / CONDITIONAL requirements whose asserted condition ALREADY
HOLDS in the clean base. Ground-truth verified against the base the run
consumed:

  - VREQ-022 "Confirm hr.employee key column is employee_id" -> PK already
    employee_id  => mutator changes nothing => self-raise => rejected_unsafe
  - P21 "Confirm employee_eligibility.eligibility_rule_id FK exists" -> FK
    already present => rejected_unsafe
  - P20 "Verify plan_inclusion not isolated; add FK if applicable" -> already
    has outbound FK to project.project => rejected_unsafe

These already-true requirements were FALSE-COUNTED as misses, capping
adherence. The status tally confirmed: rejected_unsafe=12, noop_failed=4
dominated over applied=9 in the residual.

Fix (3 edits, generic/industry-agnostic, DRY mirror of the existing
cannot-synthesize self-declaration):
  (1) synth-prompt rule-4 EXCEPTION: for verification/conditional
      requirements the mutator FIRST tests whether the condition holds and,
      if so, returns the model UNCHANGED with expected_changes_summary
      beginning 'already satisfied: <evidence>' instead of raising.
  (2) _apply_handler_with_retry recognizes _is_already_satisfied (summary
      startswith 'already satisfied') + empty diff -> status='applied'
      (not noop_failed/rejected_unsafe), logs [vov-verify-already-satisfied
      FIRED v3.2.4]. This branch MUST run BEFORE the _is_noop_diff demotion.
  (3) _v204_ast_class_hints maps the 'did not touch any target entity' and
      'did not remove any fabricated' self-check raises to the
      already-satisfied retry guidance, AND tells remove-FK mutators to
      match by FK TARGET (not exact column name).
