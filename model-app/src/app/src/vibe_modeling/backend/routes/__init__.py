"""Per-resource route modules split out of the legacy `router.py`.

Each module owns the endpoints for a single resource family and exposes a
`router` symbol — a `fastapi.APIRouter` already prefixed with the app's
`/api` prefix. The FastAPI app wires them up via `app.include_router(...)`
in `app.py`. The legacy `router.py` continues to host the `/runs/*`
endpoints (Phase 4 of the orchestrator refactor owns that surface).
