"""Clean re-run of automotive on an idle workspace for QUALITY.

The first automotive run (<profile>, 3-task install->vov->shrink) was externally CANCELLED at ~10.7h
("Run cancelled by user") during vov finalization, BEFORE the selffixer applied residual VReq fixes
(selffixer_applied=[]). Its ECM is structurally complete (581 products) but VReq adherence is only
~40% (27/69) — below the mission's 90% floor. healthcare + media_broadcasting (same age, different
workspaces) are still running, so the cancel was workspace-specific / one-off, not systematic.

This re-runs the FULL pipeline on <profile> (idle, no observed cancel) reusing the marathon's own
prepare/stage/submit/wait/export/audit functions, so the model is rebuilt identically with the full
vov + selffixer pass. Install cap trimmed to 40m (install functionally completes in <10m and only
loads _metamodel; the 2h cap just burned teardown-hang time and delayed vov). Exports overwrite
/tmp/vov_out/automotive only on success; the <profile> ECM remains on its volume as a recoverable
fallback. Does NOT touch the shared marathon state file (avoids the cross-process write race).
