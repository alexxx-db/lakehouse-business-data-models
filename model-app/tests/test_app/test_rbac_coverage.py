"""RBAC coverage — every mutating route must declare an auth marker.

Walks every route registered on the FastAPI app and asserts each has
either a role guard (``Dependencies.AdminOnly`` /
``Dependencies.BusinessAdminOnly`` / ``Dependencies.ModelerOnly``), or
appears on a curated allow-list of intentionally public / read-only
routes (``/api/version``, ``/api/current-user``, etc.).

The intent is to make adding a *new* mutating route without an explicit
auth declaration a hard test failure — so the next handler that lands
in ``routes/`` cannot silently be open to anonymous traffic.

Public-by-design routes are listed in ``_PUBLIC_ROUTES``. Read-only
GETs that intentionally don't gate — list endpoints, explorer endpoints
that the UI shows to every signed-in user — are listed in
``_READ_ONLY_ROUTES``. Both lists are minimal: anything not on them
must declare a role guard.
