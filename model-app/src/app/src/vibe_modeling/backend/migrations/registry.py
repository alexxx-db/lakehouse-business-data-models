"""Boot-time schema migration registry for the Vibe Modeling app.

Three lifecycle phases govern how :func:`reconcile_schema` behaves:

1. **Pre-prod (today).** ``PRE_PROD_DESTRUCTIVE_RESET`` is ``True`` so the
   first thing reconcile does on a version mismatch is drop the public
   schema and re-apply every migration from scratch. Test data is
   disposable; we'd rather wipe than guess at a migration story we don't
   need yet.
2. **First publish (v1.0).** ``INSTALL_POLICY`` flips to ``"strict"``
   and ``PRE_PROD_DESTRUCTIVE_RESET`` is DELETED. Fresh installs require
   an empty Lakebase project — if any tables exist that we don't own,
   reconcile refuses rather than risk colliding with a user's schema.
3. **Subsequent publishes.** Reconcile reads the version row, applies
   only migrations whose version string sorts strictly higher than the
   installed one, and refuses to start if the installed version is
   newer than what the wheel knows about (operator must roll forward,
   never backward).

The destructive-reset branch — and every reference to
``PRE_PROD_DESTRUCTIVE_RESET`` in this file — gets removed when v1.0
ships. Search for the constant name to find the deletion sites.
