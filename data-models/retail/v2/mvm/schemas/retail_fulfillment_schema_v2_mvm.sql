Each record links one carrier service to one fulfillment node with attributes that exist only in the context of this node-specific carrier configuration.. Existence Justification: In retail fulfillment operations, carrier service availability is explicitly configured per fulfillment node by operations managers. A single carrier service (e.g., FedEx Ground) serves hundreds of fulfillment nodes across the network, and each fulfillment node uses multiple carrier services (typically 3-8) with node-specific priority rankings, cutoff times, and daily volume caps. This is an operational business process called node carrier configuration or carrier service assignment that fulfillment teams actively manage.';
