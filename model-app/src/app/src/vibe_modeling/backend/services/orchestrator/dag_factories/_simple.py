"""Single-step DAG factories for the four "simple" intents.

The four intents covered here each map to exactly one
:class:`OperationStep` — no fan-out, no skip predicates, no
``needs_version_from`` chains. The orchestrator persists one
``RunOperation`` row per run, dispatches it on ``start()``, and walks
to a terminal state in a single observe pass once the underlying
Databricks job completes.

Per ``docs/orchestrator-design.md`` §3:

* Factories are pure (no DB, no workspace client). The route handler
  passes in the ``req`` (the validated ``RunIn`` body), the resolved
  ``Business`` / ``BusinessContext`` / ``AgentConfig`` rows, and any
  carry-keys the handler already worked out (e.g. the resolved target
  catalog and the parent ``ModelVersion`` row).
* Factories may emit warnings via the returned ``Dag``'s validation
  surface — but for the simple intents there is no cross-step rule
  to violate, so today every Dag returned here has zero warnings.

Per the Phase-4 briefing, the route handler is responsible for
populating the ``RunOperation.parent_version_id`` field on the
persisted row before the orchestrator advances the DAG. The factory
itself does NOT thread ``parent_version_id`` through ``params`` — it
flows on the :class:`OperationContext` instead (spec §2 reconciliation
brief #1).
