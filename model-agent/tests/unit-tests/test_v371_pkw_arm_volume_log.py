"""Behavioral tests for v3.7.1 alias=pkw-arm-volume-log (BUG-C diagnostic).

ROOT CAUSE context: gov_transport v3.7.0 (run <run_id> @ <profile>) crashed with a
transient AttributeError, then sat RUNNING ~57 minutes despite the v3.6.9
process-kill-watchdog being armed on the crash path (finally -> _arm_finalization_watchdog
-> _spawn_process_kill_watchdog, 360s grace). The watchdog ARM event was only print()ed
to driver stdout, which is LOST when the driver wedges -- so there was zero persisted
evidence of whether the watchdog armed, and BUG-C (why it didn't kill) was unrootcauseable.

THE FIX: _arm_finalization_watchdog now ALSO logs the ARM event via the volume logger
(widgets_values["logger"]), which survives a hang and is mirrored by the poller. On the
next crash, if this line shows grace=G but the run stays RUNNING beyond G+60s, the
external SIGTERM/SIGKILL child is conclusively the culprit.

Test 1 (structural): the notebook contains the pkw-arm-volume-log marker.
Test 2 (behavioral): calling the REAL _arm_finalization_watchdog with a recording logger
emits the ARM-LOG warning (with grace + pkw_grace), while _spawn_process_kill_watchdog is
stubbed so no real terminator process is spawned.
Test 3 (negative): no logger in widgets_values -> graceful (no exception, no spawn change).
