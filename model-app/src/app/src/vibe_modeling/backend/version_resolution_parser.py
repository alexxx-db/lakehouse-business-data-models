"""Parser for the agent's ``Version Resolution`` / ``Version Collision Auto-Resolved``
progress event.

Background
----------
When the agent detects that the version it was about to write (e.g. ``v1_mvm``)
collides with an existing artifact on Volume, it auto-bumps to the next free
ordinal (e.g. ``v3_mvm``) and emits a single ``stage_warning`` event:

    _vibe_writer.emit_step(
        stage_name="Version Resolution",
        step_name="Version Collision Auto-Resolved",
        status="stage_warning",
        progress_increment=0.0,
        message=msg,
        result_json={
            "original_target": 1,
            "new_target": 3,
            "target_scope": "mvm",
            "source_version": 1,
            "source_scope": "ecm",
        },
    )

The App pre-allocates the output version at observe-time via
``next_version_for_scope``. Without parsing this event, that allocation
recomputes ``v1`` while the agent has already written to ``v3``, leaving the
``ModelVersion`` row out of sync with the Volume artifacts the agent
produced (the 2026-05-04 test workspace incident).

Contract
--------
Predicate (BOTH must hold):

* Primary: ``stage_name == "Version Resolution"`` AND
  ``step_name == "Version Collision Auto-Resolved"``.
* Hardening: ``result_json`` contains all three of
  ``original_target``, ``new_target``, ``target_scope``.

When the predicate fires AND ``original_target != new_target``, the parser
records the resolution as the authoritative version for the run + scope.
Two consumers read this record:

1. ``_sync_orch_progress_events`` (this module): if a ``ModelVersion``
   row already exists for this run + scope at ``original_target``, atomically
   re-stamp it to ``new_target`` (and rewrite any ``RunArtifact.file_path``
   strings that embed the old version segment).
2. ``observe_generation_op`` (``services/operations/_generation_common.py``):
   on success, before computing ``next_version_for_scope``, call
   :func:`lookup_resolved_version` and prefer that ordinal when present.

Storage
-------
The parser does NOT add a column. The decision is durable inside the
already-persisted ``RunProgressEvent.result_json`` blob for this run.
:func:`lookup_resolved_version` re-queries that blob, which avoids a
Lakebase migration (per ``feedback_lakebase_branching_mandatory``).

Atomicity
---------
The handler runs inside the caller's open ``Session`` and never commits
on its own — the caller's ``_advance_tick`` commits once per tick. All
mutations (MV row, dependent RunArtifact rows) flow through that single
transaction. If we cannot atomically reach a consistent state (e.g. the
MV row's ``version`` doesn't match ``original_target`` — agent and App
disagree on the pre-allocated value), the handler fails the run via
``transition_run`` so we never produce a half-resolved state.
