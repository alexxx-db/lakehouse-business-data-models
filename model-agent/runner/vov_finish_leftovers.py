"""Finish the 4 leftovers from the old-cap marathon wave.

Two classes, both reduced to "ECM is (or will be) on the volume -> shrink -> MVM -> export -> audit":
  - partials  (consumer_goods, semiconductors): ECM written, shrink was cap-killed before MVM.
                Their old marathon run is terminal, so drive() Phase-1 sees ecm-ready+terminal and
                goes straight to a fresh shrink.
  - reds      (retail, health_insurance): the marathon 3-task run hit the old 4h vov cap (-> no/late
                ECM), BUT an earlier UNCAPPED single-task `vibe modeling of version` run is still
                finishing the ECM naturally (~6.8h). drive() Phase-1 waits on THAT run, then shrinks.

Reuses vov_canary_finish.drive (wait-vov / submit-shrink / export) + vov_audit_extract.extract, so no
new orchestration logic. Shrink cap bumped to 5h to match the marathon's new policy; the substantive-
idle hang-guard in wait_for_completion still bounds any post-MVM teardown hang, so the larger cap is
pure upside. Safe to run alongside the marathon daemon: it only touches industries the daemon has
already finished and moved past, and submit_shrink reuses the existing ECM catalog (never drops it).
