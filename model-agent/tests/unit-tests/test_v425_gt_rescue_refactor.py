"""
v4.2.5 behavioral tests -- gt-rescue-refactor (RC3).

ROOT CAUSE (retail v2 ECM VOV, run <run_id>): holistic-refactor VReqs
    "ensure a household table exists in the customer domain" / "re-home service_case
    out of the customer domain" scored PARTIAL with the generic "Model changed but
    cannot confirm intent" evidence and were NOT credited, keeping physical adherence
    at 78.9% below the 90% floor -- even though the household table WAS created and
    service_case WAS re-homed in the shipped model.

FIX: the deterministic _gt_rescue gains two FULFILLED-ONLY, PHYSICALLY-GROUNDED
    rescues (alias gt-rescue-refactor): table-exists (credited iff the target table
    physically exists) and re-home (credited iff the table physically moved off the
    named source domain). Upgrade-only -> can rescue a false-negative, can NEVER
    inflate beyond genuine satisfaction (S8.3).

Tests extract the SHIPPED regexes (not copies) and prove correct table/domain parse,
plus assert the physically-grounded FULFILLED-only contract in the shipped source.
