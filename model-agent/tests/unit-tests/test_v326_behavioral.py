"""v3.2.6 behavioral tests.

RC-A (vov-mislabeled-action-residual): next_vibes sometimes mislabels a
directive's ACTION (e.g. action='rename_attribute' whose body is actually
"ensure pension_plan attribute exists / add pension_plan_id FK", or
action='rename_attribute' whose body is "confirm key is employee_id; attach
glossary term"). The deterministic handler cannot parse the label-implied
fields and returns (False, 'rename-names-missing' / 'rename-new-name-missing').

PRE-PATCH: such a directive was TERMINALLY marked skipped_unsafe and never
added to _residual, so the LLM residual synthesizer (which reads the full
source_quote and could apply the real intent) never saw it -> the vibe was
silently lost even after the agentic loops (the dominant gov_transport mvm_v4 +
Retail ecm_v4 vibe-loss class, ground-truth 2026-06-05).

POST-PATCH: these label/body-mismatch diags are routed into _residual with
outcome status='requeued_residual' and a [vov-mislabeled-action-residual
FIRED v3.2.6] log line. Generic / industry-agnostic; DRY (reuses _residual).
