/**
 * Track 6 item 4 (0.6.6 bug bash): the sidebar's active-item highlight was
 * URL-prefix-only (`path.startsWith("/businesses")` etc.), so an industry
 * detail page - which lives under `/businesses/$businessId/*` because
 * industries share the business detail surface (`kind === "industry"`) -
 * wrongly highlighted "Businesses" instead of "Industries".
 *
 * `activeArea(path, businessKind)` is the single resolver route.tsx now
 * uses instead of per-item `match(path)` predicates. It's exported as a
 * pure function, so the resolution logic itself is covered directly; a
 * second block mounts `Layout` with a mocked `useGetBusiness` to confirm
 * the resolver is actually wired into the rendered active class.
