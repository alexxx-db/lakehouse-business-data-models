"""Behavioral tests for v3.6.7 Fix#7 (alias=vibe-named-trim-preserve / vibe-named-judge-count-effective).

ROOT CAUSE under test (healthcare base-MVM live run <run_id>, error log):
the judge free-synthesised 24 domains (mostly free-invented: revenue/telehealth/population/
device/finance/access...), missing the user's vibe-named required domains. Two downstream bugs
then INVERTED the user's intent:

  Fix#7b -- the judge-count validator hard-failed `24 < min(25)` three times -> the
    soft-accept-hard-fail-on-critical-step guard logged 2 ERROR + "Max retries (3) exhausted"
    (CLAUDE.md sec10.6 hard signatures), even though the 12 missing required domains are injected
    deterministically downstream (so the real final count is >= 25). The fix validates the
    EFFECTIVE post-injection count.

  Fix#7a -- the P0.65 cap-trim preserve-set was WIDGET-ONLY (_user_specified_domains). Healthcare's
    business_domains widget was EMPTY, so the trim kept the judge's first-25 (free-invented) and
    DROPPED the 12 appended vibe-named required domains (reference/laboratory/radiology/clinical/
    billing/claim/consent/scheduling/...), the exact opposite of sec3b/sec3c. Fix#1 had patched the
    INJECT path (P0.52, widget UNION vibe) but missed THIS trim. The fix unions the vibe-named
    required domains into the preserve-set so non-required extras trim first.

These tests extract the REAL production helpers from the notebook and exercise them end-to-end
(not stubs). They FAIL on pre-patch HEAD (helpers absent) and pass post-patch.
