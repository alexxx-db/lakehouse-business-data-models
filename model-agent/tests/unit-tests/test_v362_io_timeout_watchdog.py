"""Behavioral tests for v3.6.2 alias=io-timeout-watchdog.

ROOT CAUSE this fixes: the new-base-model pipeline froze SILENTLY for the full
job budget on serverless. Deterministically reproduced on both <profile> (gov_transport) and
<profile> (healthcare): both stalled 28+ min at the setup cleanup step
("Removing Previous Run Business Folder") which calls
`dbutils.fs.rm(TARGET_VOLUME, recurse=True)`. Serverless dbutils.fs / Files-API
calls have NO client-side timeout, so a stalled UC Volume blocks the calling
thread forever. The same class also blocks `_safe_copy_local_to_dbfs`, which is
what the log-streamer daemon uses, so the hang was invisible (the streamer that
should have shown progress was itself blocked).

v3.6.2 introduces `_io_with_timeout(fn, timeout_s, logger, label)`: it runs the
blocking call in a daemon worker thread and join()s with a hard deadline. On
deadline the main thread proceeds (the abandoned daemon dies with the process)
and the helper returns (None, True). It is wired into the cleanup rm (skip on
timeout), the subfolder mkdirs (retry once on timeout), and all three
`_safe_copy_local_to_dbfs` upload strategies (timeout == strategy failure ->
fall through to the next).

These tests extract the REAL production helper from the notebook (not a stub) and
exercise every branch, then statically assert the wiring. They FAIL on
pre-v3.6.2 HEAD because the helper + wiring do not exist.
