"""Drift test between the runtime migration registry and the owner script.

This test replaces the deleted ``tests/test_app/test_migration_drift.py``,
which AST-parsed the (now-gone) ``core.lakebase._add_missing_columns``
function and compared its column list against the (also-renamed) owner
script ``scripts/apply_migrations_as_owner.py``.

The migration architecture changed in PR #176 (Phase 4 close-out):

- Runtime path: ``backend.migrations.registry.reconcile_schema()`` walks
  ``MIGRATIONS`` and applies any registered ``Migration`` whose version
  sorts strictly higher than the recorded ``LakebaseSchemaVersion``.
- Owner-script path: ``scripts/db/migrate.py`` runs out-of-band as the
  Lakebase project owner (when the app's runtime auto-migration can't
  ALTER tables it doesn't own — observed 2026-04-21 on a test workspace). It uses a
  hard-coded list of ``ADD COLUMN`` / ``ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE BIGINT`` /
  ``DROP NOT NULL`` triples.

Because the owner script copies the DDL by hand instead of importing
the registry, silent drift is possible: a new ``Migration`` lands in the
registry, ships through CI, gets deployed, and the next
owner-impersonation run silently misses the column. The previous app
process sees ``information_schema`` columns it expects, but a freshly
restarted process on a Lakebase project that pre-dates the new
migration finds the column missing and crashes on first query.

This file is the gate that prevents that regression. Each test below
fails loudly with a copy-pasteable diff if the owner script and the
registry disagree about additive ``ADD COLUMN`` migrations.

Scope notes
-----------

* The owner script's ``WIDEN_TO_BIGINT`` and ``DROP_NOT_NULL`` lists are
  one-off historical fixes (BIGINT widening for ``runs.last_consumed_step_id``
  + progress event ids; ``agent_config.agent_version`` nullability) that
  pre-date the registry. They are not produced by any registered
  migration; the test treats them as owner-script-only and asserts they
  stay that way (a future migration adding those operations would be a
  *real* coupling break and should be caught).
* Migration ``v_0_1_0`` is a full ``SQLModel.metadata.create_all`` and
  emits ``CREATE TABLE`` statements, not ``ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN``.
  The owner script intentionally does not duplicate ``create_all`` — it
  only catches up additive column drift on already-installed tables.
  Tests therefore restrict the comparison to ``ALTER TABLE`` migrations.

If an operator ever changes the coupling (e.g., ``scripts/db/migrate.py``
starts importing from ``backend.migrations.registry`` directly), update
the tests here to enforce the *new* coupling shape rather than relaxing
this one.
