"""v0.7.3 behavioral tests.

NEW-1 (alias=session-end-status-honest):
    `_finalize_common` previously hard-coded `status="stage_ended"` for the
    "Vibe Session/Session Ended" sentinel regardless of whether the caller was
    `finalize_pipeline` (success) or `finalize_pipeline_error` (failure). The
    App reads the session-end status to colour the run pill. Hard-coding
    `stage_ended` lied about the outcome on the error path. The fix:
        - `_finalize_common` now takes `end_status` (default `"stage_ended"`).
        - `finalize_pipeline` keeps the default → success pill stays green.
        - `finalize_pipeline_error` passes `end_status="stage_failed"` → red.
        - The session-bookend immediate-flush logic now also recognises
          `"stage_failed"` so the App sees the failure pill on the very next
          poll, instead of waiting for the next 10-second interval flush.
