/**
 * Shared cache-invalidation helper for the `/api/businesses` list queries.
 *
 * The businesses list is queried in two shapes:
 *   - unfiltered:        ["/api/businesses", undefined]   (home, explorer provenance)
 *   - kind-filtered:     ["/api/businesses", {kind: "industry"}]  (Industries page)
 *
 * Invalidating with the bare `listBusinessesKey()` produces
 * `["/api/businesses", undefined]`, which TanStack Query partial-matches only
 * against the unfiltered key. The `{kind:"industry"}` second element never
 * matches `undefined`, so the kind-filtered Industries list goes stale after a
 * download/kickstart/create and only refreshes on a manual page reload.
 *
 * This helper invalidates EVERY `/api/businesses` list query regardless of its
 * params via a queryKey-prefix predicate, so both the unfiltered and
 * kind-filtered lists refetch. Use it at every site that mutates the set of
 * businesses and expects the lists to refresh.
