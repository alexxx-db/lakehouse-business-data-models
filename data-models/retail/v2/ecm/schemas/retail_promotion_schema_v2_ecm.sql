Existence Justification: In retail operations, coupons are strategically distributed to multiple audience segments as part of targeted promotional campaigns (e.g., a 20% off coupon might be sent to loyalty members via email, lapsed customers via direct mail, and high-value prospects via app notification). Each segment receives multiple different coupons over time as part of ongoing promotional strategy. Retailers actively manage these distribution events, tracking which coupons went to which segments, through which channels, and measuring redemption performance by segment to optimize future targeting decisions.';
