"""v3.2.3 behavioral tests.

Root-cause fix for the ~36% VOV adherence ceiling + serial slowness observed on the
gov_transport mvm_v3 ground-truth run (2026-06-04: 26/72 landed = 36.1%, 59 zero-target synth
calls, slip parse-failed=23).

Root cause: in synthesize_handler, batches whose target_entities resolve to an EMPTY set
(cross-cutting / bulk directives, or VREQ text that names no concrete domain.product) were
handed TARGET_ENTITIES_FULL=[] while the system prompt's rule-4 "verify-before-return over
target_entities" loop iterated an EMPTY list -> the LLM-generated mutator's own
`raise ValueError('mutator did not touch any target entity')` fired on every attempt ->
3 failed retries -> rejected_unsafe. Guaranteed 0% landing for that whole class.

(F4) vov-blind-batch-nonempty-contract: when _tgt_pairs and _tgt_domains are both empty,
the synth prompt switches that batch to a NON-EMPTY-DIFF success contract and overrides
rule-4 for that batch only.

Tests EXECUTE the real inserted code block (extracted from notebook source) with controlled
locals so they prove observable behavior, not just code shape (CLAUDE.md §8.10), and also
prove the pre-patch path would have failed (§8.3 anti-tautology).
