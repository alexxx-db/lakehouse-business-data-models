"""Install the bundled vibe-modelling-agent notebook into the workspace.

The agent notebook ships inside the wheel (see ``bundled_agent.py``).
Databricks Jobs cannot reference a notebook from inside a Python wheel,
so the App copies the wheel-internal ``.ipynb`` into a real workspace
path under the App service principal's home directory and points
``AgentConfig.notebook_path`` at that copy.

This module is the single source of truth for that copy. It's used in
two places:

  * The lifespan auto-install (``core/_bundled_agent_init.py``) — runs
    on every app boot, idempotent — so a fresh install always lands
    with ``AgentConfig.notebook_path`` populated and a Databricks Job
    wired up, with no external trigger needed.
  * The admin REST route (``routes/platform.py:install_bundled_agent``)
    — manual re-install via the Settings UI, kept for the case where
    an admin wants to refresh after the bundled version bumps or after
    deleting the workspace copy.
