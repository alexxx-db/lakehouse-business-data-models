Each record links one SKU to one pricing condition and captures attributes that exist only in the context of this assignment, such as the condition value and its validity period.. Existence Justification: A pricing condition (e.g., discount, tax, freight) can be applied to many vehicle SKUs, and each SKU can have multiple pricing conditions such as MSRP, discounts, taxes, and fees. The pricing team actively creates, updates, and deletes these assignments, and each assignment carries attributes like value, validity dates, type, and status. This operational management makes the relationship a true many‑to‑many business entity.';
